Config file: You can create an optional config file for custom system backup. 
* NAME: cylonCfg.conf 
* PATH: $HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf.
* SETTINGS:
"DestinationX" is the path for backups.

(see gdrive readme for setup and how to get file id numbers)
and "gdriveSourceX" is the local directory source.
"myccfile" is a setting for ccrypt utility, a path to a default file.
If config file missing the System uses hard-coded defaults.

File setup example (Note:remove bullet points in actual file)

* Destination1="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup"
* Destination2="/run/media/$USER/iomega_320"
* gdriveSource1="$HOME/Documents"
* gdriveSource2="$HOME/Pictures"
* gdriveSource3="$HOME/Videos"
* gdriveDest1="foo123456789"
* gdriveDest2="foo125656789"
* gdriveDest3="foo123666689"
* rsyncsource="$HOME/"
* rsyncDest="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup/foo"
* myccfile="$HOME/TEST/test.cpt"

Output folder
-------------------------------------
Most system output (logfiles, backups, downloads and updates etc) 
is placed at below path, unless otherwise specified on screen.
Output folders are created with following syntax HHMM-DDMONYY-X where X
is output type i.e backup, update etc. The default path is:
$HOME/Documents/Cylon
Optional Environment variable
example= export CYLONDEST="$HOME/.cache/cylon"
This optional Environment variable is provided for users
who wish to use different destination path for program output folder
if variable is not set or does not exist, cylon uses the default path.

Dependencies
-------------------------------------
Some functions require various dependencies packages to be installed.
There are two dependencies and the rest are optional dependencies.
The optional dependencies are left to user discretion.
Software will check for missing dependencies and report if user 
tries to use a function which requires a missing one.
Software will display installed dependencies packages on cylon info page.
also "n/a" is displayed besides uninstalled options in menus
* dialog –  used for GUIs menus (Non-optional)
* expac –   used for create package lists (Non-optional)
* ccrypt –  used for encrypting
* bleachbit – for system clean and shredding
* clamav –  for malware  check
* gnu-netcat – to check for internet connection 
* openbsd-netcat – to check for internet connection
