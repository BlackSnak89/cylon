Installation
-----------------------------------------------

The PKGBUILD file is available in the AUR - Arch user repository.
Install it using an AUR helper program  or installations instructions 
on Arch user repository page of Arch linux wiki.
The program will work on any arch based system. Arch, manjaro, antergos etc.
* AUR package name : cylon

Files and setup
-----------------------------------------
Cylon files installed by package 
build are listed below:

| File Path | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| /usr/bin/cylon | The main shell script |
| /usr/lib/cylon/modules/*_module |12 library files containing functions |
| /usr/share/doc/cylon/readme.md |Help file |
| /usr/share/doc/cylon/changelog.md | History file |
| /usr/share/licenses/cylon/license.md | copyright file |
| /usr/share/pixmaps/cylonicon.png | cylon icon |
| /usr/share/applications/cylon.desktop | desktop entry file |
| /usr/share/man/man7/cylon.7 | manpage |
| $HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf | config file, optional, user made, not installed |

README.md is displayed to screen by a menu option on cylon info page.
Type "man cylon" to display manpage. 
The manpage is a truncated version of the readme file.
More information on the modules files can be found in modules_info.md
in documentation folder.

Config file: The user can create an optional config file, used mainly 
for custom system backup. If the user is not using the system backup option 
or ccrypt menu function or custom clamav scan option,
the user does not need config file.
* NAME: cylonCfg.conf 
* PATH: ``` $HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf ```
This Path can be overwritten by environmental variable see next section.
* SETTINGS:
"DestinationX" is the path for backups.
"gdrivedestX" is remote google drive directory file ID
(see gdrive readme for setup and how to get file id numbers)
and "gdriveSourceX" is the local directory source.
"rsyncsource" and "rsyncdest" provide the source and destination paths 
for rsync option in backup menu.
"myccfile" is a setting for ccrypt utility, 
a path to a default file for ease of use.
If config file missing the System uses hard-coded dummy defaults.
The config file can be edited from a main menu option or by option -c

cylonCfg.conf file setup example:
Just copy and paste this into file and change paths for your setup.
alternatively a config file template with dummy values is in documentation folder
of the repository.

> Destination1="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup"
>
> Destination2="/run/media/$USER/iomega_320"
>
> gdriveSource1="$HOME/Documents"
>
> gdriveSource2="$HOME/Pictures"
>
> gdriveSource3="$HOME/Videos"
>
> gdriveSource4="$HOME/.config"
>
> gdriveDest1="foo123456789"
>

>
> clamav_customdir="$HOME/Downloads/foo"

Output and environment variables
-------------------------------------

CYLONDEST, CYLON_CONFIG and CYLON_COLOR_OFF are three optional custom environmental variables 
used by program. If variable CYLONDEST and CYLON_CONFIG are not set or do not exist, 
cylon uses the default path. CYLON_COLOR_OFF is used for turning off colored text output.
For information on setting environment variables see arch linux wiki.

CYLONDEST

Most system output (logfiles, downloads and updates etc) 
is placed at below path, unless otherwise specified on screen.
Output folders are created with following time/date stamp syntax HHMM-DDMONYY-X 
where X is output type i.e download, update etc. The default path is:
```sh
$HOME/Documents/Cylon
```

This optional Environment variable is provided for users
who wish to use different destination path for program output folder.

CYLON_CONFIG

The default path for config file is 
```sh
$HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf
```

This optional Environment variable is provided for users
who wish to use different destination path for program config file.

CYLON_COLOR_OFF

if it does not exist or is not set cylon uses colored output. 
This optional Environment variable is provided for users
who wish to see no colour in terminal. Set it equal to "on"

EDITOR
"nano" is used as default text editor for editing config files 
IF $EDITOR user environment variable is not set. 
```sh
$EDITOR
```

Dependencies
-------------------------------------
Some functions require dependencies packages to be installed.
There are three dependencies and the rest are optional dependencies.
The optional dependencies are left to user discretion.
Software will check for missing dependencies and report if user 
tries to use a function which requires a missing one.
Software will display installed dependencies packages on cylon info page.
also "n/a" is usually displayed besides uninstalled options in menus.

gnu-netcat and openbsd-netcat peform same function, 
only 1 can be or needs to be installed, both included because of conflicts.
There are used to check that network is "up" at various points in program.

Auracle and trizen are both AUR helpers you can install 
one or both depending on preference. Auracle is a more minimalist helper. 
trizen is more fully featured. 
Auracle is recommended as in addition to menu options
it is used for -u and -n functions, plus step 24 of the package list maker(REF1)
Auracle is new and still in development hence the -git extension,
it replaced cower in version 5.1-3, as cower is obsolete. 
Trizen replaced pacaur in version 5.2-4 as pacaur is no longer maintained and is 
a wrapper of cower. 
The original pacaur and cower code modules are 
still available in documentation folder for reference.

libnotify should be installed on the vast majority of Arch systems already.

gdrive readme for config https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive ,
gdrive option syncs will Delete extraneous remote files as of V3.4-5.

dialog should already be installed in an arch linux system installed by
the arch linux installation guide on wiki. If you install Arch some other way
It may not be there, so included as depends. 

expac is used a lot and will be already installed on many systems. 

pacman_contrib contains numerous tools(checkupdates pacache etc)related to pacman , used to be part 
of pacman before version 5.0. In cylon 5.3 added as a dependency.

| Dependencies| Usage |
| ------ | ------ |
| dialog |  used to make GUIs menus (Non-optional) |
| expac |   used to create package lists (Non-optional) |
| pacman-contrib | Misc pacman related tools (Non-optional) |
| libnotify | used for desktop notifications | 
| ccrypt |  used for encrypting |
| bleachbit | for system clean and shredding |
| clamav |  for malware check |
| gnu-netcat | to check for internet connection | 
| openbsd-netcat | to check for internet connection |
| rkhunter | to check for rootkits |
| rmlint | to check for lint and duplicates | 
| rsync | for rsync backup function |
| lynis | system audit |
| speedtest-cli  | testing internet bandwidth |
| Arch-audit | Uses data collected by the Arch CVE team |
| trizen(AUR)  |  AUR helper  |
| auracle-git(AUR) |  AUR helper  |
| gdrive(AUR) | to sync to google drive |
| lostfiles(AUR) | to scan for lostfiles |
