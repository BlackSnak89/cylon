**1: System update section**
* pacman options
	* see "man pacman" for more details
	* 11 12 The paccache script, is provided by the pacman package itself.
	* 13 The command to delete orphans is sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)
	* 15 The pacman database is located at path /var/lib/pacman/local
	* 16 The Arch linux news feed is fetched from this url https://www.archlinux.org/feeds/news/

	* 18 pactree - package dependency tree viewer, A tool installed as part of pacman
	* 19 pacman config file is located at etc/pacman.conf
	* 20 pacman log is located at /var/log/pacman.log
	* 21 pacman-optimize is another tool included with pacman for 
improving database access speeds. pacman stores all package information in a collection of small files, 
one for each package. Improving database access speeds reduces the time taken in database-related tasks, 
e.g. searching packages and resolving package dependencies.  See pacman tips/tricks in Arch wiki for more information.

* cower options
	* see "man cower" for more details
	* Downloads and updates are downloaded to the Output folders as defined in 
"Output and environment variables" section of readme.md. The setting "TargetDir" in cower config file must not be used
cylon will check this and display warning.
	* 4 The optional install after download consists of a display of the PKGBUILD
and prompt to install or not. 
	* 5 After update command, Cylon checks if output directory has child directories
to see if there is an update downloaded, Next it offers to view PKGBUILD of any updates
and finally asks do you want to install them. If you do not want to install some of the updates
for some reason you can manually delete their folder from output folder before this point.
	* 9 Config file
cower honors a config file which will be looked for first at:
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cower/config
and falling back to: $HOME/.config/cower/config
A documented example config file can be found at
/usr/share/doc/cower/config.
	* 10 The dialog package is used to create a GUI menu containing all foreign 
packages on system , output of pacman -Qmq , If ok pressed pacman -Rs is used to remove package.
	* 11 A AUR package without a maintainer or AUR Orphan Packages(not to be confused with system orphan see pacman section)
	Is a PKGBUILD in the AUR database with no maintainer. 
	This option loops thru all foreign packages on system (output of pacman -Qmq)
	and uses command "cower -i --format %m" to check for maintainer. It will show if any package on your system 
	is not maintained in the AUR system.
