Files and setup
-----------------------------------------
Cylon files installed by package 
build are listed below.

* /usr/bin/cylon (the main shell script)
* /usr/lib/cylon/modules/*_module (12 module files containing functions)
* /usr/share/doc/cylon/README.md
* /usr/share/doc/cylon/changelog.md
* /usr/share/licenses/cylon/LICENSE.md
* /usr/share/pixmaps/cylonicon.png (cylon icon)
* /usr/share/applications/cylon.desktop (desktop entry file)
* /usr/share/man/man7/cylon.7 (manpage)
* $HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf (optional, user made, not installed)

README.md is displayed to screen by a menu option on cylon info page.
Type "man cylon" to display manpage. 
The manpage is a truncated version of the readme file.
More information on the modules files can be found in module_info.md.

Config file: The user can create an optional config file, used mainly 
for custom system backup. If the user is not using the system backup 
or ccrypt menu functions the user does not need config file.
* NAME: cylonCfg.conf 
* PATH: 
```sh
$HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf
```
* SETTINGS:
"DestinationX" is the path for backups.
"gdrivedestX" is remote google drive directory file ID
(see gdrive readme for setup and how to get file id numbers)
and "gdriveSourceX" is the local directory source.
"rsyncsource" and "rsyncdest" provide the source and destination paths 
for rsync option in backup menu.
"myccfile" is a setting for ccrypt utility, 
a path to a default file for ease of use.
If config file missing the System uses hard-coded dummy defaults.
The config file can be edited from a main menu option or by option -c

cylonCfg.conf file setup example:
Just copy and paste this into file and change paths for your setup.

> Destination1="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup"
>
> Destination2="/run/media/$USER/iomega_320"
>
> gdriveSource1="$HOME/Documents"
>
> gdriveSource2="$HOME/Pictures"
>
> gdriveSource3="$HOME/Videos"
>
> gdriveSource4="$HOME/.config"
>
> gdriveDest1="foo123456789"
>
> gdriveDest2="foo125656789"
>
> gdriveDest3="foo123666689"
>
> gdriveDest4="foo123662222"
>
> rsyncsource="$HOME/"
>
> rsyncDest="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup/foo"
>
> myccfile="$HOME/TEST/test.cpt"

Output folder and environment variables
-------------------------------------
Most system output (logfiles, backups, downloads and updates etc) 
is placed at below path, unless otherwise specified on screen.
Output folders are created with following time/date stamp syntax HHMM-DDMONYY-X 
where X is output type i.e backup, update etc. The default path is:

```sh
$HOME/Documents/Cylon
```

Optional Environment variable: $CYLONDEST
How to set example: 
```sh
export CYLONDEST="$HOME/.cache/cylon"
```

This optional Environment variable is provided for users
who wish to use different destination path for program output folder
if variable is not set or does not exist, cylon uses the default path.

Dependencies
-------------------------------------
Some functions require various dependencies packages to be installed.
There are two dependencies and the rest are optional dependencies.
The optional dependencies are left to user discretion.
Software will check for missing dependencies and report if user 
tries to use a function which requires a missing one.
Software will display installed dependencies packages on cylon info page.
also "n/a" is displayed besides uninstalled options in menus.

gnu-netcat and openbsd-netcat peform same function, 
only 1 can be or needs to be installed, both included because of conflicts.

cower and pacaur are both AUR helpers you can install 
just cower or both depending on preference. pacaur wraps cower 
and needs it installed. 
The setting TargetDir in cower config file must not be used
cylon will check this and display warning.

gdrive readme for config https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive
gdrive option syncs will Delete extraneous remote files as of V3.4-5

dialog should already be installed in an arch linux system installed by
the arch linux installation guide on wiki. If you install Arch some other way
It may not be there, so included as depends. expac is used a lot and will 
be already installed on many systems.
