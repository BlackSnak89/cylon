Cylon is a bash script installed to /usr/bin by package

as listed below, see optdepends of PKGBUILD also. 
This is left to user discretion.
Software will display optdepends installed packages on cylon info page.

cylon files 

* /usr/bin/cylon (the shell script)
* /usr/lib/cylon/modules/*_module (modular functions called by script)
* /usr/share/doc/cylon/Readme.md
* /usr/share/doc/cylon/changelog.md
* /usr/share/licenses/cylon/License.md
* $HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf (optional, user made, not install)

Readme.md is displayed to screen by a menu option on cylon info page
A manpage is also installed together with menu entry and Icon.
You can create an optional config file for custom system backup called 
NAME: cylonCfg.conf, PATH: $HOME/.config/cylon/cylonCfg.conf
"DestinationX" is the path for backups
"gdrivedestX" is remote google drive  directory ID(see gdrive readme)
and "gdriveSourceX" is the local directory source.
If config file missing the System uses hard-coded defaults.
File setup example (Note:remove bullet points in actual file)

* Destination1="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup"
* Destination2="/run/media/$USER/iomeaga_320"
* gdriveSource1="$HOME/Documents"
* gdriveSource2="$HOME/Pictures"
* gdriveDest1="foo123456789"
* gdriveDest2="foo123456789"
* rsyncsource="$HOME/"
* rsyncDest="/run/media/$USER/Linux_backup/foo"

Most system output (logsfiles, backups, downloads and updates etc) 
is placed at below path , unless otherwise specified on screen
output folders are created with following syntax HHMM-DDMONYY-X where X
is output type i.e backup, update etc
* $HOME/Documents/Cylon
